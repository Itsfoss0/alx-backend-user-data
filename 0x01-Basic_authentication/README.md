## About
HTTP Basic Authentication is a simple authentication mechanism used to secure web resources. It involves sending a username and password in the headers of an HTTP request.

## Background context
In this project, you will learn what the authentication process means and implement a Basic Authentication on a simple API.

In the industry, you should not implement your own Basic authentication system and use a module or framework that doing it for you (like in Python-Flask: [Flask-HTTPAuth](https://flask-httpauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)). Here, for the learning purpose, we will walk through each step of this mechanism to understand it by doing.
